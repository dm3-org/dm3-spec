# dm3 - encrypted and decentralized web3 messaging

## 1. General

### 1.1. Abstract
In a digital age where communication is at the heart of human interaction, the dm3 protocol emerges as a solution that redefines the landscape of messaging. The protocol, designed to cater to the evolving needs of both technologically savvy enthusiasts and casual users alike, paves the way for encrypted and decentralized web3 messaging.

Traditional methods of communication, from email to web2 messaging platforms, have long been accompanied by challenges like centralized control, lack of interoperability, and compromised privacy. Recognizing these limitations, the dm3 introduces a comprehensive approach to addressing these pressing needs. This whitepaper serves as a guiding light, illuminating the architecture, features, and user-centric values that constitute the core of the dm3 protocol.

### 1.2. Rethinking Digital Communication
In today's digital age, communication has evolved into an essential facet of modern life, enabling instant connections across the globe. However, the existing communication landscape presents several challenges that the dm3 protocol aims to address.

**1.2.1. The Limitations of Traditional Communication Methods**

**Email's Decentralization and Unencrypted Communication**
Email, an early Internet innovation, initially offered decentralized communication. Yet, it grappled with issues such as a lack of adequate spam protection and widespread unencrypted transmission. While protocols emerged to address these concerns, mainstream adoption of encryption remained limited, leaving a significant portion of email communication vulnerable.

**SMS and its Encryption Gap**
Short Message Service (SMS) revolutionized communication with its device-to-device text messages. However, SMS messages are transmitted without end-to-end encryption, posing security risks. This encryption gap raises concerns about data privacy in an interconnected world.

**Web2 Messengers and Closed Silos**
The emergence of web2 messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram promised end-to-end encryption. Still, these platforms operate as closed silos, limiting cross-platform and cross-app communication. This fragmentation hinders true interoperability and user data control, emphasizing the need for a more open and decentralized solution.

### 1.3. Introducing the dm3 Protocol
In response to the challenges and limitations posed by traditional communication methods and the emerging complexities of the web3 landscape, the dm3 protocol emerges as a transformative solution. At its core, the dm3 protocol seeks to establish a seamless, decentralized, and user-centric messaging ecosystem within the web3 space.

**1.3.1. A Foundational Standard for Web3 Messaging**
Anchored by the DM3MTP (dm3 message transfer protocol), dm3 protocol acts as a linchpin, connecting diverse messaging services, applications, and protocols within the web3 ecosystem. Its primary objective is to set forth a foundational standard that fosters interoperability and integration, addressing the longstanding challenge of siloed communication platforms.

Central to the dm3 protocol's ethos is the empowerment of users. By offering a range of features designed to maximize user autonomy, dm3 ensures that individuals retain control over their data, messages, and communication preferences. This liberation extends to the choice of messaging applications that align with individual needs, thereby dismantling the limitations associated with platform confinement.

In essence, the dm3 protocol represents a paradigm shift in communication. By seamlessly integrating self-sovereign identity, encryption, and interoperability, dm3 upholds users' autonomy and control while enabling the creation of a decentralized messaging ecosystem. As the dm3 protocol embodies the principles of web3, users are invited to explore a new era of messaging that places them at the centre of their digital interactions. 


## 2. Market
### 2.1. Market size (potential users)
In the ever-evolving realm of communication, messaging has emerged as a cornerstone of digital interactions. With the proliferation of modern messaging platforms, the number of active users has surged, illustrating the integral role these tools play in our interconnected world.

**2.1.1 The Current Landscape**
As we peer into the present, it's evident that messaging platforms have etched themselves into the lives of over a quarter of the global population. Around 26% of individuals ([source](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/research/market-research/worldwide-messaging-apps/)) are engaged with one or more messaging platforms, ranging from household names like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Viber, Line, to Snapchat. Leading this pack is WhatsApp, boasting 2.7 billion monthly active users ([source](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-whatsapp-users/)), closely followed by Facebook Messenger with 931 million ([source](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-facebook-messenger-users/)), and Telegram with 700 million monthly active users ([source](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-telegram-users/)).

**2.1.2.Transitioning to Protected and Confidential Communication**
In a world where the metaverse increasingly hosts our interactions, this user base is poised to grow even further. This shift isn't just about expanding numbers; it's about users seeking alternatives that offer the promise of genuine privacy and security. They yearn for communication where they retain true ownership of their conversations, away from the prying eyes of centralized entities.

While the messaging landscape is currently dominated by centralized giants, the emergence of web3 players is signaling a new wave of possibilities. These players, rooted in blockchain technology, are pioneering the path to decentralized, secure, and private communication.

**2.1.3. The Potential of Blockchain**
When delving into potential users who are already adopting chat and email services built upon blockchain technology, we uncover intriguing insights. More than 80 million crypto wallet users had been created by 2022 ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/)), underscoring the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions. Within this cohort, a noteworthy 449,918 wallets were actively engaged on the Ethereum blockchain as of June 2023 ([source](https://www.demandsage.com/blockchain-statistics/)), highlighting the Ethereum network's prominence.

As a protocol deeply integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), dm3 protocol's reach aligns with the Ethereum ecosystem. ENS, reporting over 50 thousand monthly active users in September 2022 ([source](https://messari.io/report/state-of-ens-q3-2022)), solidifies the Ethereum blockchain as a stronghold for potential dm3 users.


### 2.2. Advantages of the dm3 Protocol in the Web3 Messaging Landscape 
In the rapidly evolving messaging landscape, the dm3 protocol distinguishes itself by introducing several key advantages that change the way we communicate in the web3 era. These advantages usher in a new era of privacy, security, and interoperability:
